# Sergiu BatrÃ®nac

This is my personal portfolio website. It is built with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS.

## Cloning the project & installing dependencies

To set up the project, you can use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# clone the project to a new directory
git clone https://github.com/sergiulache/svelte_portfolio.git

# install dependencies
npm install
```

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
